Your mission is to fill all the cells ensuring that no two neighboring cells (horizontally or vertically) share the same number.

It starts at index 0 and ends at index 4 in the original array.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [12,17,15,13,10,11,12]\nOutput: (33, 4, 6)\nExplanation: [10,11,12] is the ascending subarray with the maximum sum of 33. It starts at index 4 and ends at index 6 in the original array.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: nums = [100,10,1]\nOutput: (100, 0, 0)\nExplanation: [100] is the ascending subarray with the maximum sum of 100. It starts and ends at index 0 in the original array.\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`\n`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`"

This encompasses dynamically modifying the level of detail based on the user's proximity to the 6D model, and managing the balance between visual quality and performance. \n\nTo escalate complexity, the AI mechanism should also be capable of forecasting and adapting to future alterations in the 6D model files, such as the incorporation of new elements or modifications in the animation sequences. It should also be proficient in optimizing the 6D models based on the hardware capabilities of the target device, ensuring optimal performance across a diverse range of devices.\n\nMoreover, the AI mechanism should be competent in handling the optimization of 6D models that are part of a complex, multi-threaded system, where the 6D models may alter in response to multiple concurrent processes. \n\nTo further escalate the challenge, the AI mechanism should be capable of optimizing 6D models that are part of a complex, multi-paradigm system, where the optimization process needs to consider the interactions between multiple programming paradigms and the 6D models. \n\nThe AI mechanism should also be capable of handling the optimization of 6D models that are part of a machine learning system, where the optimization process needs to consider the interactions between multiple learning algorithms and the 6D models. \n\nAdditionally, the AI mechanism should be competent in handling the optimization of 6D models that are part of a quantum computing system, where the optimization process needs to consider the interactions between quantum algorithms and the 6D models. \n\nTo further escalate the challenge, the AI mechanism should be capable of handling the optimization of 6D models that are part of a complex, multi-agent system, where the optimization process needs to consider the interactions between multiple AI agents and the 6D models. \n\nFurthermore, the AI mechanism should be capable of handling the optimization of 6D models that are part of a distributed computing system, where the optimization process needs to consider the interactions between multiple distributed computing nodes and the 6D models. \n\nAs a reference, consider the following flawed code snippet that attempts to optimize a 6D model file:\n\n```python\ndef optimize_6D_model(model):\n    try:\n        # Attempt to optimize the model\n        optimized_model = model.optimize()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f&amp;#34;Failed to optimize model: {e}&amp;#34;)\n        return None\n\n    return optimized_model\n```\n\nThis code neglects to consider the complexity of the 6D model, the hardware capabilities of the target device, and the interactions between the model and other systems or processes.

It should support user registration and profile management. The platform should also have a search and filter function for users to find relevant papers. The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    (\"User registration and profile management system\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Paper submission system\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Peer review system\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Search and filter function for papers\", \"P1\"),\n    (\"User-friendly and intuitive interface\", \"P1\")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe platform should have a clean and minimalistic design. The homepage should display a search bar, a list of recent papers, and options to submit a paper or start a review. Each user's profile page should display their submitted papers and reviews. The paper submission and review pages should be simple and easy to navigate.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo implement this academic paper submission and review system, we will use Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is open-source and has a large and active community, which means that it has many third-party packages that can be used to add functionality to our project.\n\nFor user registration and profile management, we will use Django's built-in User model and authentication system. For paper submission and peer review, we will create custom models and views. We will use Django's ORM for database operations.\n\nFor the frontend, we will use Bootstrap, a free and open-source CSS framework, to ensure that our website is responsive and user-friendly. We will also use jQuery, a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library, to add interactivity to our website.\n\nTo implement the search and filter function, we will use Django's Q objects for complex queries and the django-filter third-party package for filtering.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n\"academic_paper_platform\"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    \"manage.py\",\n    \"academic_paper_platform/settings.py\",\n    \"academic_paper_platform/urls.py\",\n    \"academic_paper_platform/wsgi.py\",\n    \"users/models.py\",\n    \"users/views.py\",\n    \"users/urls.py\",\n    \"papers/models.py\",\n    \"papers/views.py\",\n    \"papers/urls.py\",\n    \"reviews/models.py\",\n    \"reviews/views.py\",\n    \"reviews/urls.py\",\n    \"templates/base.html\",\n    \"templates/home.html\",\n    \"templates/user_profile.html\",\n    \"templates/paper_submission.html\",\n    \"templates/review_submission.html\",\n    \"static/css/main.css\",\n    \"static/js/main.js\"\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class User{\n        +str username\n        +str email\n        +str password\n        +str first_name\n        +str last_name\n        +date date_joined\n        +bool is_active\n        +bool is_staff\n        +bool is_superuser\n        --init__(username: str, email: str, password: str, first_name: str, last_name: str)\n    }\n    class Paper{\n        +int id\n        +str title\n        +str abstract\n        +str keywords\n        +date submission_date\n        +User author\n        --init__(title: str, abstract: str, keywords: str, author: User)\n    }\n    class Review{\n        +int id\n        +str content\n        +date submission_date\n        +User reviewer\n        +Paper paper\n        --init__(content: str, reviewer: User, paper: Paper)\n    }\n    User \"1\" -- \"*\" Paper: submits\n    User \"1\" -- \"*\" Review: writes\n    Paper \"1\" -- \"*\" Review: receives\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant P as Paper\n    participant R as Review\n    U->>P: submit_paper(title, abstract, keywords)\n    P->>U: confirm_submission()\n    U->>R: write_review(content, paper)\n    R->>U: confirm_submission()\n    U->>P: search_papers(keywords)\n    P->>U: return_results()\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ##

The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.

So only the second letter `&#39;o&#39;` in `S` is changed to `&#39;d&#39;`, the answer is `&#34;hdld&#34;`.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: A = &#34;leetcode&#34;, B = &#34;programs&#34;, S = &#34;sourcecode&#34;\nOutput: &#34;aauaaaaada&#34;\nExplanation:  We group the equivalent characters in `A` and `B` as `[a,o,e,r,s,c]`, `[l,p]`, `[g,t]` and `[d,m]`, thus all letters in `S` except `&#39;u&#39;` and `&#39;d&#39;` are transformed to `&#39;a&#39;`, the answer is `&#34;aauaaaaada&#34;`.\n\nNote:\nString `A`, `B` and `S` consist of only lowercase English letters from `&#39;a&#39;` - `&#39;z&#39;`.\n\nThe lengths of string `A`, `B` and `S` are between `1` and `1000`.\n\nString `A` and `B` are of the same length.\n\nYour solution should not exceed O(n^2) time complexity."

It is possible for me to create another processing job that does this plotting. However, I prefer the job to be self-contained.\nOnly one option that might fit my needs comes to my mind which is monitoring through regular expressions as in plotting learning curves like here: [Monitor and Analyze Training Jobs Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/training-metrics.html). It is pretty tedious to plot a matrix of dimensions say 10k * ~300 columns like that. So, I wonder about more native ways to do this task.\nThanks in advance"

It should have an intuitive interface and a feedback mechanism to improve the recommendation algorithm. The system should also learn from the user's reading habits to provide more relevant recommendations over time.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    (\"Implement a recommendation algorithm that provides personalized news\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface\", \"P0\"),\n    (\"Incorporate a feedback mechanism for users to rate the relevance of recommendations\", \"P1\"),\n    (\"Enable the system to learn from user's reading habits to improve recommendations\", \"P1\"),\n    (\"Include a feature for users to save or share articles\", \"P2\")\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe main elements of the interface should include a news feed, a navigation bar, and a feedback form. The news feed will display the recommended articles, with each article showing a headline, a brief summary, and a thumbnail image. The navigation bar will allow users to navigate to different sections of the app. The feedback form will allow users to rate the relevance of the recommendations they receive. The overall design should be clean and minimalistic, with an emphasis on readability.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nWe will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility.

You can return the answer in any order. However, the permutations should not contain any subsequence that is in ascending order with a length greater than 2.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1,2,3], the permutation [1,2,3] is not valid because it contains the subsequence [1,2,3] which is in ascending order and has a length greater than 2. However, the permutation [1,3,2] is valid because it does not contain any subsequence in ascending order with a length greater than 2.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\nOutput: [[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,1]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1]\nOutput: [[1]]\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= nums.length <= 6`\n`-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`\nAll the integers of `nums` are unique.\n\nTo increase the difficulty, here is a piece of erroneous code for reference:\n\n```python\ndef permute(nums):\n    def backtrack(first = 0):\n        if first == n:  \n            output.append(nums[:])\n        for i in range(first, n):\n            nums[first], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[first]\n            backtrack(first + 1)\n            nums[first], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[first]\n            \n    n = len(nums)\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n```\n\nThis code does not check for the constraint of subsequences in ascending order with a length greater than 2.
